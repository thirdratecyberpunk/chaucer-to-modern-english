# chaucer-to-modern-english
A tab delimited parallel corpus of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales to a modern day translation.

## Contents
This repository contains the translations provided by Harvard  University on their [Geoffrey Chaucer website](https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/text-and-translations) of Chaucer's [The Canterbury Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales) in a more machine friendly format. The content has been cleaned and human evaluated to ensure that each line has a matching translation. Each tale is available as a separate tab delimited text file and also combined with all other tales.

## Format
Each line contains the original Chaucerian dialogue, followed by a tab delimiter, followed by a modern day English translation.

## Why?
I prepared this dataset as part of my final year project, as there were few other parallel data corpuses in a tab delimited format.
